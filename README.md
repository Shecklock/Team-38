<h2>How to run</h2>
 When running the code, a database is needed, some of the migration are not fully functioning and our team decided in order to let things work, we modify th database directly in phpmyadmin. The sql of the database is included in the file u_220036506_ecommerce

 After database was made, you may need to modify the .env file as while for database connection, .env file of this project is under Team-38/Backend/
 Modify the following part so that it matches your database:

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=u_220036506_ecommerce
DB_USERNAME= "your user name"
DB_PASSWORD= "Your password"

after connection of the database, the applciation shoulkd work fine
